# Dynamic Optimization of Apache Kafka Configurations

This repository focuses on implementing **dynamic optimization of Apache Kafka configurations** using **process mining** techniques. The project aims to enhance Kafka's performance by dynamically analyzing logs and adjusting configurations. Reinforcement learning integration is planned for future iterations.

## Features

- Dockerized environment for running Kafka and Zookeeper.
- Process mining for identifying performance bottlenecks.
- Scripts to interact with Kafka and log producer-consumer data.
- Planned integration of reinforcement learning for automated configuration optimization.

## MSK Setup and Implementation

The setup is designed to create a **managed Kafka environment** using Docker. The implementation includes:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - A `docker-compose.yml` file to configure Kafka, Zookeeper, and their dependencies.
   - Customizable settings to emulate different Kafka scenarios.

2. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Logs generated by Kafka producers and consumers are stored in the `log_files/` directory for analysis.
   - The system is prepped for integration with process mining tools to extract insights.

3. **Dynamic Configuration**:
   - Scripts are provided to adjust Kafka configurations and monitor the impact on performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Python 3.8+ with `pip`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamsaimsheikh/dynamic-optimization-msk.git
   cd dynamic-optimization-msk
   ```

2. Set up the Kafka environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the implementation script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/implementation.py
   ```

## Planned Reinforcement Learning Integration

The future plan involves integrating reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust Kafka configurations in real time. The RL algorithm will aim to:

- Continuously monitor performance metrics.
- Learn optimal configurations for producer and consumer settings.
- Automate adjustments to improve throughput and reduce latency.

## Usage

1. Modify Kafka configurations in `docker-compose.yml` for your testing needs.
2. Analyze the log files generated during Kafka operations to gain performance insights.
3. Prepare for reinforcement learning integration by customizing the monitoring scripts.
